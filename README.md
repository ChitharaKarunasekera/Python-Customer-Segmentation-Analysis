# Customer Segmentation Project

This project uses clustering techniques to analyze and segment wholesale customer data, providing insights into purchasing behaviors and enhancing targeted marketing strategies.

## Getting Started

## Usage

The notebook `Customer_Segmentation_and_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` contains the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the wholesale customer data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including scaling and handling missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions, correlations, and relationships.
4. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features based on correlation analysis.
5. **Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate clustering performance using silhouette score and visualize clusters using PCA.
7. **Results Interpretation**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and derive insights.

## Results

- **Silhouette Score**: 0.4243, indicating moderate clustering quality.
- **Cluster Profiles**: Detailed descriptions of customer segments based on purchasing behaviors.
